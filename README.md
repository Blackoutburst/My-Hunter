# My Hunter
My Hunter is a school project, this project is a shooter game like duck hunt. This game is called Magicel Hunt and I use pixel art design.

## Gameplay
You just move arround with your mouse and you have to kill every ghost before they get to the green crystal in the center of the screen. You have 3 lives and every ghost who past the middle screen remove you one life, if the player ran out of live it's the game over.
